# Course Scheduler

## Overview
A Java-based course scheduling tool developed for PSUT’s CMPSC221 class (Object-Oriented Programming with Web-Based Applications). The app offers graphical user interfaces for both students and instructors, allowing:

- Students to build and manage personal course schedules  
- Instructors to modify student enrollments and class details

It uses Java Swing for front-end GUI and Apache Derby as an embedded database to handle scheduling logic.

## Features
- **Student & Instructor Interfaces:** Separate GUI modes tailored to user roles  
- **CRUD Operations:** Create, read, update, and delete course and enrollment records  
- **Embedded Database:** Uses Apache Derby for persistent data storage without external dependencies  
- **User-Friendly UI:** Built with Swing for responsive desktop interaction

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java  
- **GUI Framework:** Swing  
- **Database:** Apache Derby (embedded)  
- **Build Tools:** (Include if appropriate—e.g., Ant, Maven, or Gradle)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** — version 8 or above  
- **Optional:** Apache Derby if running separately

### Installation & Running
1. Clone the repo into your local environment.
2. Build and run using your preferred tools (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ, or command line).
3. Launch the main application class (e.g., `CourseSchedulerMain`) to start the UI.

## Example Screenshots
*(Optional: Add screenshots of the student and instructor UIs for visual context.)*

## Why It Matters
This tool demonstrates:
- Effective user interface design in Java  
- Seamless integration of GUI and embedded database  
- Practical application of OOP principles in a real-world educational context
